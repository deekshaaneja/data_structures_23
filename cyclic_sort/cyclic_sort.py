'''
Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n)
 and without using any extra space.
 For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers,
 though each number is actually an object.
 [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
  [1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
